Hi there!
------


I'm currently starting my PhD journey towards computational chemistry.   

My research interests mainly center around method development and applications of atomistic modeling in physical chemistry.  

Feel free to reach out! I would be delighted to connect with anyone for discussions on atomistic modeling and related interdisciplinary topics.
