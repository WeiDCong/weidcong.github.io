Biomacromolecule structures are essential for drug development and biocatalysis. Quantum refinement (QR) methods, which employ reliable quantum mechanics (QM) methods in crystallographic refinement, showed promise in improving the structural quality or even correcting the structure of biomacromolecules. However, vast computational costs and complex quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) setups limit QR applications. Here we incorporate robust machine learning potentials (MLPs) in multiscale ONIOM(QM:MM) schemes to describe the core parts (e.g., drugs/inhibitors), replacing the expensive QM method. Additionally, two levels of MLPs are combined for the first time to overcome MLP limitations. Our unique MLPs+ONIOM-based QR methods achieve QM-level accuracy with significantly higher efficiency. Furthermore, our refinements provide computational evidence for the existence of bonded and nonbonded forms of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug nirmatrelvir in one SARS-CoV-2 main protease structure. This study highlights that powerful MLPs accelerate QRs for reliable protein–drug complexes, promote broader QR applications and provide more atomistic insights into drug development.
